Use markdown for documentation (.md files) and link to github?

Could set up a Jupyter Hub for python.

Could set up a BRIDGE account on github (Greg may have one that he controls)

Could set up an organisation on github.

Quick start for writing docs on github: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github 

Quick start for github pages: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

Obsidian: 
https://forum.obsidian.md/t/internal-links-not-working-on-github/50058/2
**To use Markdown links from the start so you donâ€™t have to convert them later, disable Settings > Files & Links > Use Wikilinks.**

To upload a file from PC to github:
On web interface, + -> New repository.  Choose existing folder.

Downloaded GitHub Desktop which seems quite nice.

Had to play around a bit with the .obsidian folder.  I had to add .obsidian to the .gitignore file.  And then remove from github.  But keep on local folder (had to remove and then remake "vault")

Now seems to sync quite well.
