BluePebble is possibly the future of local hardware.  Could have a head-node plus a disk.  However, Digital Labs may be replacing Bluepebble.  See [University_HPC](University_HPC)

Need an eocene replacement.  

Also need to replace oligocene/holocene.

Fund via Capital Bids?

Oligocene: web server.  Very old.

Holocene4: sitting around doing nothing

Triassic: very old

Silurian: also old

David Gardner is currently overloaded and so has little time for new development work.

Rocky8 now on miocene.  But not tested.  gfortran does not compile all the scripts.  Intel compiler is fine though.  qplot does not compile.

Plan - open miocene up to group.  When working, send to group and ask for feedback.

Eocene2 doesn't work with old servers.

Needs a 2-week blast on this.
