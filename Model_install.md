The original CD with the code from the Met Office is lost

gcom is the hardest part of the install.  Gethin does this part.

nupdate is also a challenge.

Gethin has a cut-down version of the install.

Once the cut-down version is running, Paul modifies to make changes associated with running on different machines etc. invisible to the user, via clustersubmit.

Could put the model on github (Richard at BRICS also suggested this).
